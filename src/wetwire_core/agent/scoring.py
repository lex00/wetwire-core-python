"""Scoring rubric implementation.

Each session is scored on 5 dimensions (0-3 scale):

| Dimension           | 0                    | 1                  | 2                  | 3                  |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Completeness        | Failed to produce    | Missing resources  | Most resources     | All resources      |
| Lint Quality        | Never passed         | Passed after 3     | Passed after 1-2   | Passed first try   |
| Code Quality        | Invalid syntax       | Poor patterns      | Good patterns      | Idiomatic          |
| Output Validity     | Invalid              | Valid with errors  | Valid with warnings| Clean              |
| Question Efficiency | 5+ questions         | 3-4 questions      | 1-2 questions      | 0 (when appropriate)|

Overall Score: 0-15
- 0-5: Failure
- 6-9: Partial success
- 10-12: Success
- 13-15: Excellent
